# Facial Recognition Project

Welcome to the Facial Recognition Project repository! This project aims to develop a facial recognition system using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system utilizes various stages, including face detection, feature extraction, and classification, to identify and recognize faces in images or video streams.

## Project Overview

The Facial Recognition Project focuses on implementing state-of-the-art algorithms and methodologies in the field of computer vision and artificial intelligence. The primary objective is to develop an accurate and efficient facial recognition system that can be applied to real-world scenarios.

## Features

- Face detection using Haar cascades: The system utilizes Haar cascades, a popular technique for detecting faces in images or video frames.
- Feature extraction with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Pre-trained CNN models, specifically the ResNet-50 architecture, are employed to extract rich facial features.
- Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM): The extracted features are used to train an SVM classifier for facial recognition and identification.
- Performance metrics: The system provides evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the facial recognition model.

## Usage

To use the Facial Recognition Project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies and libraries specified in the project documentation.

2. Set up the project environment, ensuring compatibility with your system.

3. Provide input data, such as images or video streams, for the system to perform facial recognition on.

4. Run the facial recognition system and observe the results, including identified faces and associated classification outcomes.

**Note: Before running the code, make sure to update the dataset paths in the code to match your own dataset.**
In the Python code, you will find specific lines where the dataset paths are specified. You need to modify these paths to point to your own suitable dataset directory. 

## Results

The Facial Recognition Project has demonstrated promising results in terms of accuracy and efficiency. During testing, the system achieved a precision rate of 100%, recall rate of 73%, and an F1 score of 84%. These metrics indicate the system's capability to correctly identify faces while minimizing false positives.

## Future Work

While the Facial Recognition Project has achieved notable results, there are potential areas for further improvement and expansion. Some suggested areas for future work include:

- Enhancing the face detection algorithm to handle challenging lighting conditions and occlusions.
- Exploring alternative deep learning architectures and feature extraction methods to improve recognition accuracy.
- Investigating real-time implementation of the facial recognition system to enable applications in video surveillance and monitoring.
